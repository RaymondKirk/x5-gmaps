A major upgrade to include Typescript support. While there should be no noticeable change for anyone not using Typescript, almost every line of the entire library had to be rewritten ðŸ˜£

### Added

- Declaration files and types for Typescript support

### Changed

- Library now uses the `@Component` format of Vue 2 which is needed for Typescript
- Some internal scripts for generating the library and documentation
- Almost every single line of code in the library (good luck tracking changes ðŸ˜¥)
